                        If you want to be good at React, building projects is
                        one of the best ways to do it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have put together eight different projects that will
                        not only show you what's possible to make with React,
                        but give you some inspiration on what apps to make.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I will give you all the tools that you
                        need to effectively build out each project in the list.
                    </p>

                    <p>Let's get started!</p>

                    <h2>Todo App</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you want to get started building projects, there's no
                        better starting place than a simple todo app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A todo application will feature basic CRUD
                        functionality, meaning that you can create, read, update
                        and delete todos. Todos can be replaced with whatever
                        type of content that you want. In fact, many
                        applications we use on a daily basis could arguably be
                        considered glorified todo apps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The benefit of building a todo app is that the entire
                        app can be made in a short period of time. If you can
                        build a todo app without any tutorial to guide you, it
                        is a good test to see your proficiency with React.
                    </p>

                    <div class="todo">
                        <img src="./image/To do.png" alt="TodoMVC todo app" />
                        <figcaption>TodoMVC todo app</figcaption>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Todo apps are a great project to begin with because you
                        do not need any third-party libraries to build them. You
                        can make your todo app as complex as you like, which
                        will help you become confident with concepts that you
                        want to learn. Want to add authentication or a database
                        to your app? Feel free to do so! You can truly make it
                        as simple or complex as you like.
                    </p>

                        <li>That's it!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Personal Blog</h2>
                    <p>A step up from the basic todo app is a blog website.</p>

                    <p>
                        If you would like to write in Markdown, which is a
                        popular style of writing and formatting text, your blog
                        will likely consist of a number of Markdown (.md) files.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you want the content to be included locally within
                        the project to make it a bit more difficult, you could
                        try fetching it from an external source like a CMS
                        (content management system) such as Sanity or
                        Contentful.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        src="./image/BLOG.png"
                        alt="Next Blog Starter Kit (https://next-blog-starter.vercel.app/)"
                    />

                    <p>
                        In either case, this blog is going to consist of static
                        pages so you can use any static site generator that you
                        like.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A good framework choice for this blog could be Next.js
                        or Gatsby. Both are ideal to make text-driven websites
                        like blogs because they are server-rendered frameworks
                        and give you better SEO. This is compared to a
                        traditional client-rendered React app (one made with
                        Create React App, for example).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our stack will consist of one of these React frameworks
                        plus a transformer to convert our markdown content into
                        HTML when our site is built. A good choice to transform
                        our markdown content is the remark npm package.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you want to make an even more impressive blog, with
                        dynamic content, then you can consider using MDX. MDX is
                        very similar to plain markdown, but it also allows you
                        to include your own custom React components within the
                        markdown.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To use MDX, you would use a package like next-mdx-remote
                        if you're using Next.js. The plain mdx-js/mdx package
                        also works great.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Stack To Use</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Next.js/Gatsby</li>
                        <li>Markdown or MDX (remark or mdx-js/mdx)</li>

                    <p>
                        Just a quick note: for each of these projects, I won't
                        be talking about styling. I personally prefer using
                        plain CSS in the form of TailwindCSS. You can head to
                        Tailwind's website to see how to easily set that up for
                        whatever React framework you're using.
                    </p>
                    <h2>E-commerce App</h2>
                    <p>
                        The next step up from our blog project is an e-commerce
                        app.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It has a lot of similar features to our blog, including
                        the fact that most of the content is going to be largely
                        static and unchanging.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once again, the data can be sourced locally or fetched
                        from a CMS at build time. What's different about an
                        e-commerce app is that it allows us to venture into
                        working with a server of some sort.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        src="./image/E-Commerce.png"
                        alt="Next.js E-commerce App"
                    />
                    <p>
                        If you want your customers to purchase an item through
                        Stripe, for example, you might want to set up a webhook
                        that will receive an event from Stripe when your
                        customer has purchased a particular item. This is
                        essential for managing things like your product
                        inventory.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To very easily write server-side code, you could use an
                        API route so that you don't have to set up a complete
                        Node.js project. This function would process different
                        events that take place upon checkout or after checkout.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, if you don't want to have to touch any
                        server-side code, you can avoid the stripe npm package
                        entirely and just use
                        <strong>Stripe checkout</strong> or a
                        <strong> Stripe payment link.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Going forward, every project that we're going to touch
                        on will involve a server of some sort. Most every
                        application you use has a backend and a frontend. React
                        will always be the frontend of our application but be
                        aware that for any of these projects, you can very
                        easily set up a server for your application to handle
                        things like talking with a database when you have a
                        framework like Next.js.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next.js includes a special type of page called an API
                        route, which allows you to do server-side things such as
                        authentication, webhooks, reading and writing to a
                        database, and much more. Additionally, we'll touch on
                        some solutions like Firebase that don't require you to
                        make a backend at all!
                    </p>

                    <h2>News/Community App (Reddit Clone)</h2>
                    <p>
                        A Reddit clone that is centered around sharing links or
                        very simple posts is a good step up from our todo app.

                        We are still creating, updating, and deleting data, but
                        this time it's going to be saved in a database. We might
                        allow users to add different types of content, like a
                        video or a link or a short post. We can use Firebase for
                        our project to get started, which will give us the
                        <strong>Firestore database.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our Firestore database will consist of a simple
                        collection that will save all of the individual posts
                        that a user has made. We can further develop it by
                        allowing other users to add comments and likes to the
                        posts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An even more developed app would include authentication.
                        Fortunately, <strong>Firebase Auth</strong> makes it
                        very easy. We can also add likes to individual comments
                        and replies to comments for our comment threads.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We could use any React framework for this. A good choice
                        would be one using a <strong>Vite</strong> template. For
                        our individual posts, we would need dynamic routes to
                        fetch individual posts based off of their id. A good
                        choice for that would be React Router.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Messenger App (WhatsApp Clone)</h2>
                    <p>
                        An offshoot of this type of realtime app would be a
                        messenger-style app like that of WhatsApp.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        src="./image/whatsapp clone.gif"
                        alt="WhatsApp clone, made with React"
                    />
                    <p>
                        This app would be a little bit more limited in that
                        conversations are usually done with one person, although
                        they don't have to be. Instead of talking in channels
                        you will have different options to talk with one or
                        another person at a time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A good touch would be to add notifications when someone
                        messages you. This is another app example that would
                        require realtime data functionality from your database.
                        Firebase is always a good option for that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If Firebase gets boring, you could try Supabase which is
                        a very competitive alternative also with realtime
                        database features, but which is backed by Postgres
                        instead of Firestore.

                    <p>
                        What if instead of having an app where one person talks
                        directly with another person in a very confined space,
                        you want the opposite, where anyone can interact with
                        anyone!
                    </p>

                    <p>A great example of this type of app would be Twitter.</p>
                    <img
                        src="./image/twitter clone.gif"
                        alt="Twitter clone, made with React"
                    />
                    <p>
                        Twitter is an app that requires a feed as well as a
                        trending page in a user's feed. The user will be able to
                        see all of the posts from the people that they follow.
                        But on the trending page, they will see all of the most
                        popular posts across the entire website.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To be able to figure out which posts are the most
                        popular, you will add the ability to like (heart) a
                        given post as well as re-share it, which allows a post
                        to be added to or associated with another user. Finally,
                        you will want to allow users to directly reply to other
                        posts (like Twitter's "quote tweet" feature).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And another fundamental feature that could be added to
                        every app that we've covered up until this point is
                        search. In our Twitter clone, users would likely want to
                        be able to search for different users to follow as well
                        as posts based on their content.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One downside to Firebase is that it does not have the
                        best tools for search and it's not easy to perform
                        queries that are based on a certain keyword. This is one
                        instance in which <strong>Supabase</strong> would be a
                        superior alternative.

                    </ul>
                    <h2>Video Sharing App (YouTube/TikTok Clone)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The last fun project in this list is a video sharing app
                        such as YouTube or TikTok.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The two apps have very similar features, with YouTube
                        primarily focusing on long form video content and Tiktok
                        mainly consisting of super-short videos under a minute.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Both platforms utilize an infinite scroll feature,
                        whether you're scrolling through suggested videos or
                        recommended videos. TikTok itself is arguably just one
                        big infinite-scrolling feed.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        src="./image/Tik tok clone.gif"
                        alt="Tiktok clone, made with React"
                    />
                    <p>
                        What would be hardest to implement about both these
                        platforms is the algorithm. You could go very far on
                        building an app that just relies on users following
                        other users and having a homepage with the most popular
                        videos. Your users would first be suggested videos from
                        the people that they follow and then the popular videos
                        on the site.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most essential feature for both TikTok and YouTube
                        is streaming video. To allow users to upload their own
                        content you need a service that includes an upload API.
                        Some good choices in this area are
                        <strong>Cloudflare Stream,</strong> Video.js, or Mux.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All of these tools provide you with a video player as
                        well as an API, which would handle uploading videos that
                        could then be posted to the site.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I would personally build this app using my own server
                        and database. I would probably choose
                        <strong>Prisma</strong> as the ORM (object-relational
                        mapped) to interact with the database which would be a
                        <strong>MySQL </strong> database managed by Planetscale.
